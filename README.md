# Nursery-Automation-using-IoT
This is a mini project I have worked on in order to automate some of the functionalities of a nursery. 
Using IoT, it is easy to build an application that makes human life easier. It decreases the efforts of humans 
physically and gives pinpoint values. Nowadays, we see IoT in every domain. 
One of the domains is a nursery where the plants are maintained in various weather 
conditions. The main objective of this paper is to develop an automated model which 
can also be monitored for the good growth of the plants in a nursery. Since various tiny 
plants are grown in a nursery, it is very important to monitor and maintain good 
weather conditions which plays a key role. The parameters like humidity, temperature, 
and soil moisture are taken to monitor the plants. Whenever the temperature values are 
high, a fan is activated to maintain the temperature so that the plants will grow healthy. 
This model is developed using Arduino AT Mega 328, ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module, and 
sensors like humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. The values predicted by these 
sensors can be viewed on a Free application
